It has been a few years now that I am been working towards it. The people who have been around me for long enough have been asked this question over and have discussed about it at length.
Let's talk about it now.
1. **Work** - It should be your utmost priority in life. Making enough money in your life will make sure all other dominos of life stay as desired. ***No it doesn't mean, being enslaved by work because it is just one of the things we aim for***
2. **Workouts** - Once you have made enough money for the day, second order of priority is to make sure you workout and keep your body healthy. *No, walking for 30 minutes straight in the morning and post dinner doesn't count. [why?](https://mohit.dev/thought/why-walking-is-not-an-exercise)*
3. **Food** - Eating the right type of food is next on the list. Once you have become fixated with your work and workout schedules, the obvious is to think that you have earned it and can enjoy food and booze. No you cannot. You got to realise that it is one of the most important check item if you want to prolong your life expectancy. You are allowed to be indulged in booze and junk food but only in moderation.
4. **Books** - If you are serious about your ability to process information and create opportunity, you have to get into the rabbit hole of books. Netflix and other mediums are shallow. Neither do you don't have any edge over others who saw the same content. You get advantage when you read things at your pace, revisit it, explain it to a layman and similar to the game of tennis, you got to make another shot winning move to win the set.
5. **People** - Fifth in proprity is people. This includes everybody. Your family, your lovers et cetera. Some of you might feel that why family is put down so below on the list of priority, let me explain why. Spending time with family and lovers is one thing, but holding the ability to provide financial shelter, a room of healthy habits and discussions on dinner table are much more important than simply spending time. Once you start keeping a schedule, you will realise that you should have done this earlier.
6. **Social** - If you have time left in your day, spend it on Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. One thing I would want you to consider is, whether you are a consumer or content creator. If you are a consumer, keep a tab to not get swayed away. If you are a creator, make sure you automate enough to passively make money.

One of the the key fundamental in setting your priority in life is to never miss on to actionable back to back. By this I mean, you may skip workout session or get indulged in too much Netflix but just make sure it is never repeated on consequitive days. When you miss things back to back, third day there's no to little incentive to go back and things start to fall apart.
